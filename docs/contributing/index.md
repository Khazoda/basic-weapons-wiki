# How to Contribute

:octicons-bug-24: If you have ideas, suggestions, or bugs to report, please create an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Khazoda/basic-weapons/issues/new).

:material-brain: There are long term plans for datapack-driven modular weapon support. This would enable simplistic weapon addition without requiring java knowledge, but this plan is still in its infancy.

## How to Contact

:octicons-mail-24: I occasionally read and reply to CurseForge comments, so if you'd like to contact me there, please feel free. However, please _do not ask_ about updating the mod to the latest Minecraft version. I either am already working on an update, intend to in the future, or do not intend to support that version (if it is a minor version that mods aren't jumping to support).

## License
